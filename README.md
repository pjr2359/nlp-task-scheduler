# nlp-task-scheduler
A Natural Language Parser used for task scheduling as I hate the calendar app...

## Features

- Accepts natural language input (e.g., "Remind me to go to the gym tomorrow at 7 PM")
- Parses dates and times from input using `chrono-node`
- Displays task confirmation and parsed date
- Handles task scheduling on both backend (Express.js) and frontend (React)

## Getting Started

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation
